Question 2.
Task:
Implement two classes according to the given instructions.
Part 1: Class Person (20 Points)
Requirements:

The class should have the following attributes:

person_id, name, and age as protected attributes.
These attributes are passed as parameters to the constructor.
Validation: Ensure no two objects have the same person_id. If a duplicate is detected, raise an appropriate exception.

Use a static dictionary to track existing person_id values.
The class should have the following methods:

sleep: Receives sleep time (in hours) as a parameter and prints:
"The person <name> sleeps for <sleep_time> hours"
work: Receives work time (in hours) and hourly wage, calculates the total wage, and prints:
"The person <name> works for <work_time> hours and earned <wage> shekels"
Override the __str__ method to return:
"The person's name is <name> and they are <age> years old."

Part 2: Class Lecturer (10 Points)
Requirements:

Inherits from the Person class.
Adds the following attributes:
lecture_name and weekly_hours as protected attributes.
These are passed as additional parameters to the constructor.
Overrides the work method:
Calls the parent class's work method, passing weekly_hours as the work_time parameter.

Explain the difference between __str__ and __repr__. When should each be used?

"""
Answer:

__str__:

Purpose: Provides a human-readable string representation of an object.
Usage: Used when print(obj) or str(obj) is called.
__repr__:

Purpose: Provides an unambiguous representation of an object, often used for debugging.
Usage: Called by repr(obj). Ideally, it should return a string that can recreate the object.

Task 3: (6 Points)
Explain what a virtual environment in Python is and why it is useful.
"""
"""
Answer:
What is a Virtual Environment:
A virtual environment is an isolated Python environment with 
its own dependencies and Python interpreter.

Why Use It:
To prevent dependency conflicts between projects.
To ensure a project uses specific versions of libraries without affecting other projects.

Example:
Create a virtual environment: python -m venv my_env
Activate it: source my_env/bin/activate (Linux/Mac) or my_env\Scripts\activate (Windows).
Install libraries specific to the environment: pip install numpy.

Task 4: (6 Points)

"""
"""
Answer:

iloc:
Access rows and columns by index positions (integer-based).

loc:
Access rows and columns by labels (label-based).
"""

Task 5: (6 Points)
Explain the difference between mutable and immutable classes.

"""
"""
Answer:
Mutable Classes:
Their state can be changed after creation.
Examples: list, dict, set.

Immutable Classes:
Their state cannot be changed after creation.
Examples: int, float, tuple, str.
Dictionary Keys:

Only immutable types can be used as dictionary keys because their hash value must remain constant.
